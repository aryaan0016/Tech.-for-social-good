BINARY NUMBERS
The basic language that a computer can think is in terms of 0 and 1, and using that we make the computer understand a complex data.
CONVERSION(BINARY TO DECIMALS)
The binary numbers can be converted into decimals by representing each digit as power of 2.
Eg. 1011= 1x2^3+0x2^2+1x2+1x2^0= 8+0+2+1=11(in decimals)
CONVERSION(DECIMALS TO BINARY)
We can convert by dividing decimal no. by 2 ,write the remainder either 0 or 1, and repeat the process with the quotient until it becomes 0
Eg. 13(decimal): 
13/2=6 (remainder=1)
6/2=3 (remainder=0)
3/2=1 (remainder=1)
1/2=0 (remainder=1)
Now, by writing the remainders in reverse order we get 1101(binary)
